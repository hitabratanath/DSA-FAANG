"""LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters 
(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

Example 1:
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

Constraints:
- 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
- text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.
