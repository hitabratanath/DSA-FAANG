"""MERGE TRIPLETS TO FORM TARGET TRIPLET

A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array triplets, where triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] describes the ith triplet. You are also given an integer array target = [x, y, z] that describes the target triplet.

To form the target triplet, you can perform the following operation as many times as you want (possibly zero):
- Choose two indices (0-indexed) i and j (i != j) and update triplets[i] to be [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].

For example, if triplets[i] = [2, 5, 3] and triplets[j] = [1, 7, 5], triplets[i] will be updated to [max(2, 1), max(5, 7), max(3, 5)] = [2, 7, 5].

Return true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet [x, y, z] as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the operation on triplets[0] and triplets[2]:
triplets[0] = [max(2,1), max(5,7), max(3,5)] = [2,7,5].
The target triplet [2,7,5] is now an element of triplets.

Example 2:
Input: triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]], target = [3,2,5]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to have [3,2,5] as an element because there is no 2 in any of the triplets.

Example 3:
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[2,3,4],[1,2,5],[5,2,3]], target = [5,5,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the operation on triplets[0] and triplets[3]:
triplets[0] = [max(2,5), max(5,2), max(3,3)] = [5,5,3].
Perform the operation on triplets[0] and triplets[2]:
triplets[0] = [max(5,1), max(5,2), max(3,5)] = [5,5,5].
The target triplet [5,5,5] is now an element of triplets.

Constraints:
- 1 <= triplets.length <= 10^5
- triplets[i].length == target.length == 3
- 1 <= ai, bi, ci, x, y, z <= 1000
